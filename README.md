# cie_paper_quality

The goal of this web application is to have two separate portals - one for Teachers and another for Committee members. Teachers can create an account and upload appropriate CIE Papers, while Committee members can view and assess the papers uploaded by teachers. The Committee members can provide feedback on any changes or approve the papers through a comment box.

The purpose of this website is to eliminate the need for offline assessment of CIE papers just before the test date, which can be a time-consuming process.

Currently, the project is still in development and is being created using various programming languages and technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Django, Python, and PostgreSQL.
